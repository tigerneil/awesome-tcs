- [Induced subgraphs of hypercubes and a proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00847.pdf)

  - **Author**: Hao Huang

  - **Abstract**: In this paper, we show that every $(2^{n-1}+1)$-vertex induced subgraph of the $n$-dimensional cube graph has maximum degree at least $\sqrt{n}$. This result is best possible,and improves a logarithmic lower bound shown by Chung, FÃ¼redi, Graham and Seymour in 1988. As a direct consequence, we prove that the sensitivity and degree of a boolean function are polynomially related, solving an outstanding foundational problem in theoretical computer science, the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy
